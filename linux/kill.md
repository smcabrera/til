# Kill

Just to help me remember. When you need to kill a process:

"Use the ps command if you need to find the PID of a process. Always try to kill a process with a simple kill command. This is the cleanest way to kill a process and has the same effect as cancelling a process. If this does not work use the -1 (one) signal."

Rails will helpfully tell you where its server lives so you can go forth and kill it when it's run amok.
