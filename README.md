# Today I Learned
Taking an idea from [thoughtbot](https://github.com/thoughtbot/til), I'm going to maintain this repo to track and share things I learn. The idea is to maintain small markdown notes (TILs) with a few sentences and code examples. Later on I can use these for fuel for my blog when I get a few together on similar topics, or else just share small ones on twitter.
